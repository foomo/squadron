# Introduction

Welcome to **Squadron** — Docker Compose for Kubernetes.

Squadron is a tool that brings Docker Compose paradigms to Kubernetes, enabling developers to keep working with the same familiar patterns they already know. Instead of learning new deployment models, you define your infrastructure once using Docker Compose concepts and deploy it to Kubernetes without friction.

## Why Squadron?

Docker Compose is intuitive and powerful for local development. Kubernetes is the industry standard for production. Squadron lets you use the same thinking and workflows for both—no paradigm shift required.

With Squadron, you:

- **Use familiar Docker Compose patterns** — define services, networks, and volumes the way you already do
- **Deploy to Kubernetes seamlessly** — same definitions work in production without rewrites
- **Keep your workflow consistent** — think in the same mental model across all environments
- **Focus on your application** — not on learning Kubernetes-specific abstractions

## Production-Ready

Squadron is battle-tested and used in production by BestBytes. It's designed for real-world workloads and proven to scale reliably.
